Perl has many approaches to achieving concurrent execution and parallel
computing. These approaches work at different levels of data analysis ranging
from splitting up jobs using Perl [threads](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlthrtut.html)
and [forks](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfork.html) to parallel computations
using GPU and MPI modules and to harnessing Perl for Big Data tasks (for
example Blekko's [use of clusters](http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/yapcna_2013.html)
for crawling the Web).

More information on packages that can help you get started can be found on the
software page under the "Parallel Computing" section.
